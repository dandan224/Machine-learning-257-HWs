If the training data is changed (e.g. a tree is trained on a subset of the training data) the resulting decision tree can be quite different and in turn the predictions can be quite different. **After running few times, the std sometimes very low,  or higher, or very high, each time was quite different, consistent with its cons.**\n","\n","2) Bagging is the application of the Bootstrap procedure to a high-variance decision trees. When bagging with decision trees, we are less concerned about individual trees overfitting the training data. For this reason and for efficiency, the individual decision trees are grown deep (e.g. few training samples at each leaf-node of the tree) and the trees are not pruned. These trees will have both high variance and low bias. These are important characterize of sub-models when combining predictions using bagging.** So the mean of the score is quite good but the std is higher compare to the other algrithoms after a few times running.**\n","\n","   1. Random forest changes the algorithm for the way that the sub-trees are learned so that the resulting predictions from all of the subtrees have less correlation. Combining predictions from multiple models in ensembles works better if the predictions from the sub-models are uncorrelated or at best weakly correlated. The random forest algorithm changes this procedure so that the learning algorithm is limited to a random sample of features of which to search. **After several times running, it shows the stable variance, the std doesn't change too much each time.**\n","\n","   2. ExtraTrees classifier always tests random splits over fraction of features, in contrast to RandomForest, which tests all possible splits over fraction of features. ExtraTrees being a bit worse when there is a high number of noisy features. **After several times running,  the std change but not too much each time. From the comparation of current std of the three bagging methods, it is consistent with their pros and cons .**\n","\n","3) Boosting is a an approach to calculate the output using several different models and then average the result using a weighted average approach. It focus new learners on examples that other get wrong, train learners sequentially and convert weak learners into strong classifier. The Boosting model has high accuracy when it works.\n","\n","   1. AdaBoost algorithm uses to correct its predecessor is by paying more attention to under-fitted training instances by the previous model. But in noisy data when you have outliers, due to the nature of the algorithm it overfits on them. Therefore it is sensitive to outliers.** From the several running, the std is so different each time, shows the high variance. **\n","\n","   2. Gradient Boosting works by sequentially adding the previous predictors underfitted predictions to the ensemble, ensuring the erros made previously are corrected. The difference lies in what it does with the underfitted values of its predecessor. Contrary to AdaBoost, which tweaks the instance weights at every interaction, this method tries to fit the new predictor to the residual errors made by the previous predictor.** From the ten times running, it shows the same mean and std occasionally, perhaps it means more accuracy.**\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"1WHVanMhd6Qa","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---\n","\n","### Print out the \"feature importances\" of this best model.\n","\n","The model has an attribute called `.feature_importances_` which can tell us which features were most important vs. others.
